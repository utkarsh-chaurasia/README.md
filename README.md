## 🧐 About


### 👋 ✨ Hi, I'm Utkarsh Chaurasia.

Pursuing an undergraduate degree at the **National Institute of Technology, Raipur**. I am currently in 4th year in the **Information Technology** Branch. Based on my tech stack in Java, C, C++, Python, GUI, HTML, CSS, JS, Express JS, Node JS, React JS, Mongo DB, AI, MS, DL, and some freelancer work as a front-end developer and experience in Deep Learning research Intern I believe I could be a good fit.
